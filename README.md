# Reinforcement Learning with options 

This repo contains an agent which evolves in a gridworld (for the moment) and solves for instance a Key/Door problem using the option framework of Sutton-Precup-Singh (see the original article [here](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/Sutton-Precup-Singh-AIJ99.pdf))

The code is written with `Python 3.6` and uses the environement [gridenvs](https://github.com/aig-upf/gridenvs)

To run the experiment, clone this repo and execute `python3 main.py`.

You can change the environment in gridenvs/example/.

### N.B: gridenvs environment is being revised, it will be available soon ! *
